You can use one of the following options to connect to Neutis.

- [Serial](serial.md)

    This is the perfect choice for debugging which allows you to see the kernel log on startup and doesn't
    depend on sshd service. You need additional jumpers or USB to UART converter to connect to a device over serial.

- [USB-Ethernet](usb-ethernet.md)

    Grab one Micro-USB cable and you're good to go.

- [Wi-Fi](wifi.md)

    There's no need in additional wiring, however, it requires
    first time setup and debugging if there are any problems
    with a Wi-Fi connection.

- [Ethernet](ethernet.md)
