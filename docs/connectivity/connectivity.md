# How to connect

You can connect to your Neutis in several ways. Each of them
has its own advantages and additional requirements. Check
the list below to find out which one better fits your needs.

- [Serial](serial.md):

    Although you need additional jumpers and USB to TTL converter to
    connect to your device, this is the perfect choice for debugging
    which allows you to see the kernel log on startup and doesn't
    depend on sshd service.

- [USB-Ethernet](usb-ethernet.md):

    Grab one Micro-USB cable and you're good to go.

- [Wi-Fi](wifi.md):

    There's no need to have additional wires, but it requires
    first time setup. Hard to debug if there are any problems
    with your Wi-Fi connection.

- [Ethernet](ethernet.md)
