# First setup

In order to make use of your Neutis you'll need to flash it with a Linux image. 
You can download the [latest]() dev image. To learn more about this image
and Yocto project do not hesitate and click [here](../yocto/why.md). 

In this quick tutorial we'll guide you through and help you set up your
Neutis and make first connection over USB.

## Flashing

In order to flash your Neutis you'll need to boot it in a special mode called FEL.
You can read a bit about it [here](fel.md). You can just stick with the tutorial
for now. But we recommend you to read it thoroughly so that you could understand
how does your Neutis boot.
