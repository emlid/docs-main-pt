Flasher has user friendly gragical interface.

Session starts with initial window prompting you to choose image file and mode (flashing or testing).

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/flasher/initial_screen.png"></div>

Then you can connect Neutis units to the PC and flasher will start doing it's job.
You will see as many progress bars as many devices you have connected.  
At the end of flashing Neutis sends self-tests results and Flasher shows QR code unique for each Neutis. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="../../img/flasher/passed_tests.png"></div>

In case when one or more tests has been failed you will see list of results.  
Here an example of results layout:
